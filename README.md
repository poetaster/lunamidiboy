# lunamidiboy

tribute to the lunamod synth for midiboy/adruboy. Plays a 64 element sequence with PWM. 

The up and down keys change Frequency.

The left and right keys change duration/tempo.

Hold the B key to record changes in Frequency dynamically. 
Hold the A key to record changes in Tempo dynamically. 

Each of 64 steps Freq and duration a played back or recorded. If you adjust the temp and continue holding A you'll get your tones with the new temp/duration. Glissandi are obvious.

There is a rough animation of the Freqs. Duration/Tempo and Freq (current). Are dispalyed.
