# lunamidiboy
A tribute to the lunamod synth for midiboy/adruboy. Plays a 64 element sequence with PWM. Record changes to the sequence in realtime.

Install on a Midiboy or Arduboy with the Arduino IDE.




The up and down keys change Frequency.

The left and right keys change duration/tempo.

Hold the B key to record changes in Frequency dynamically. There is a rough animation of the Freqs. Duration/Tempo and Freq (current). Are dispalyed.

The source is based on

I've left most of the comments in place to show the original, which used potentiometers for tempo/duration and frequency.


and the inspiration comes from:

Theminimosynths are great. Buy one :) Or build one ;)
